# To-Do List Application(https://sshubham001.github.io/task-tracker/)

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks with titles and descriptions, and also delete tasks individually.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add a task by entering a title and description and clicking the "ADD" button.
- **Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button, allowing users to remove tasks individually.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored locally using the browser's localStorage API, so they persist even after the browser is closed.
